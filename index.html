    <p>A screen buffer is a two-dimensional array of character and color data for output in a console window. A console can have multiple screen buffers. The active screen buffer is the one that is displayed on the screen.
        The system creates a screen buffer whenever it creates a new console. To open a handle to a console's active screen buffer, specify the CONOUT$ value in a call to the CreateFile function. A process can use the CreateConsoleScreenBuffer function to create additional screen buffers for its console. A new screen buffer is not active until its handle is specified in a call to the SetConsoleActiveScreenBuffer function. However, screen buffers can be accessed for reading and writing whether they are active or inactive.
